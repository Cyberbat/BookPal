# BookPal
Book-Pal reinforces the idea of spreading knowledge at a reasonable cost. The concept of exchanging books has spiked over the past couple of years where people send books to each other either internationally or locally. Therefore basing its core concept on that idea, Book-Pal merges the social interaction with a common book exchange bringing people closer to each other solely on books. Moreover Book-Pal has an educational section dedicated for students only. Book-Pal also serves as a platform for sharing ideas hence it incorporates a blog system where users can interact. A notification system is also put in place in order to bridge communication between users. Moreover it simplifies the search for books with a filtration and search system and incorporates a message system where user can coordinate the book exchange. Additionally the system houses a web crawler that picks up on the latest books of this year basing its source on 3 well known and respected sites, and displays them to the user. The whole platform uses Laravel Framework and VueJs as its primary building blocks.
